				<h1>Hi, I’m Kyle and welcome to my site where I showcase the things I built, broke and put back together again.</h1>

				<p>
				  I’m a former applied scientist who chose to pursue web development thanks in large part to a passion for getting frustrated. 
				  I’m a big believer in failure being the fuel for success and there is noting that draws me in like a problem I can’t easily solve. 
				  When I’m not ruining the hard work my mother put in to my posture, curling over a keyboard typing away, you can find me taking 
				  things apart and putting them back together or really close to together.

				<h2 class="project-name">FlashQuiz</h2>
				<h2>/////img/////</h2>
				<p>
				  Build a deck of custom flash cards or sample what the community has built without the overly busy styling featured on other free study sites.
				   This App was built with React, Redux, Node, Mongo, making use of Passport-JWT for authentication. 
				   Continuous integration testing was setup with Travis CI, Enzyme,  Mocha, and Chai.
				   The mobile first design and monochromatic theam were chosen to primarily help me focus during the train commute to my former job.

				<h2 class="project-name">Wedding Gift-Exchange</h2>
				<h2>/////img/////</h2>
				<p>
				A small gift exchange app built to help break the ice at my wedding.
				 As people are coming from many different countries and cultures the app randomly matches people who agree to take part in the gift exchange.
				 This app was built with JavaScript, jQuery, Node, Mongo, Passport and tested with Mocha, Chai and Travis CI.

				<h2 class="project-name">Wedding Event Guide</h2>
				<h2>/////img/////</h2>
				<p>
				Weddings can be a logistical nightmare and if you wedding is a several day multiple location affair people will get the details confused.
				 Faced with this problem I built an event guid for my wedding that sorts information by day giving location, time, event details, weather and directions.
				 The app was built with JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and makes use of Google Maps API and openweathermap API.
